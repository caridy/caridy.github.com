<p>Now that YUI 3 is out, it's stable, and it's getting some traction in the developer community. Many of these developers are getting their heads around the on-demand nature of YUI 3.
</p>
<p>If you're </p>

<p>Few weeks ago, Stoyan Stefanov (<a href="http://twitter.com/stoyanstefanov/">@stoyanstefanov</a>) published the result of <a href="http://www.phpied.com/preload-cssjavascript-without-execution/">his research about preloading components in advance without executing them</a>. This technique can help improve the performance of the successive pages, if these components can be cached ahead of time.</p>
<p>We decided to port it to <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/">YUI 3</a>, the new module is called &quot;<a href="http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/preload">gallery-preload</a>&quot;, and is now available through the YUI Loader. </p>
<p>Let’s see a <a href="http://caridy.github.com/examples/gallery-preload/simple.html">preload example</a>:</p>
<pre>YUI({
    //Last Gallery Build of this module
    gallery: 'gallery-2010.05.05-19-39'
}).use('gallery-preload', function(Y) {
  Y.preload ([
    'http://tools.w3clubs.com/pagr2/1.sleep.expires.png',
    'http://tools.w3clubs.com/pagr2/1.sleep.expires.js',
    'http://tools.w3clubs.com/pagr2/1.sleep.expires.css'
  ]); 
});</pre>
<p><strong>How this module will help to improve the user experience? </strong></p>
<p>Now days, web applications have a huge footprint in terms of <em>Javascript</em>, <em>CSS</em> and <em>Images</em>. Most of these files are serviced through a CDN, hence cacheable. Once a file gets downloaded and cached, the browser doesn’t need to download the same file in successive pages. But still we have a big impact in the initial page.</p>
<p>Recent studies suggest that &quot;<em>0.1 second [100ms] is about the limit for having the user feel that the system is reacting instantaneously, more than that will make the user impatient (Jakob Nielsen)</em>&quot;. And the same happens for the loading process, if it takes too long, the user will probably close the window. So, to make sure that our application runs fast we need to be ahead of our users.</p>
<p>Web Applications like <em>Facebook</em> or <em>Gmail</em>, the user has to log-in first. This is a classic scenario to apply “preloading”. We can estimate that every user will spend between 5 and 10 seconds interacting with a form. During this time, our application is doing nothing. If we can use this time to load cacheable files in background, once the user log-in, the browser will not need to re-load some of the scripts that this new page requires, because they were cached in advance. In general, any web application with a form can leverage the technique, because 90+% of the users will head to the form's target page.</p>
<p>Some folks have used this technique for a while, but, as Stoyan pointed out, it’s hard to do it without executing the script, or injecting the CSS, or displaying the image. And in most of the cases, these files will not play nicely with the initial page. So, in order to avoid conflicts, and minimizing the time to put this solution in place, we should guarantee that these files get included in the cache without using them in the current page.</p>
<p>This process is completely harmless, and even if the user navigate or stop the loading process before the files get downloaded and cached, the fallback is always in place, and the second page will try to load the file directly.</p>
<p><strong>The following code shows how to implement this approach:</strong></p>
<pre>YUI({
    //Last Gallery Build of this module
    gallery: 'gallery-2010.05.05-19-39'
}).use('event-focus', 'gallery-preload', function(Y) {
  // waiting until the user focuses on an input element to start loading assets
  Y.on("focus", function() {
    Y.preload ([
      'http://tools.w3clubs.com/pagr2/2.sleep.expires.png', 
      'http://tools.w3clubs.com/pagr2/2.sleep.expires.js', 
      'http://tools.w3clubs.com/pagr2/2.sleep.expires.css'
    ]);
  }, ".myform input.query");
});</pre>
<p>This piece of code waits until the user focuses on one of the form input elements to start loading assets that will be used in the form's target page. This will improve the loading time of the page once the user submits the form.</p>
<p><strong>Check the differences between accessing a page directly, or preloading a set of YUI2/YUI3 components ahead of time:</strong></p>

<p><img src="preload/without-cache.jpg" /></p>

<p><img src="preload/with-cache.jpg" /></p>

<p>Including few lines of codes to preload these set of components ahead makes this page to load 4 times faster. No changes required in the logic of your application, and no change in the target page. Isn't that amazing?</p>

<p><strong>One more feature:</strong></p>

<p>We also include a more advanced feature for those who want to be less aggressive. The module includes a built-in integration with <a href="http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/idletimer">Nicholas Zakas’ Timer Idle module</a>, allowing us to preload files only if the user is inactive for a while. Here is an example:</p>

<pre>YUI({
    //Last Gallery Build of this module
    gallery: 'gallery-2010.05.05-19-39'
}).use('gallery-preload', function(Y) {
  // preload files only when the user is idle for at least 100ms
  Y.preloadOnIdle ([
    'http://tools.w3clubs.com/pagr2/3.sleep.expires.png', 
    'http://tools.w3clubs.com/pagr2/3.sleep.expires.js', 
    'http://tools.w3clubs.com/pagr2/3.sleep.expires.css'
  ], 100); 
});</pre>
<p><strong>Conclusions:</strong></p>
<p>It's important to be ahead of our users, and knowing the workflow of our users will help us to leverage the preloading to achieve that goal. It's also important to do it without introduce or increase the complexity of our current application. This new component ("gallery-preload") relies on these ideas, use it wisely.</p>
