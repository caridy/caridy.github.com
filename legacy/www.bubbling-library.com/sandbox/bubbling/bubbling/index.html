	<h1>Bubbling Technique (YAHOO.Bubbling): Tutorials</h1>
<br />

	<h3><a href="behavior-actionprompt-bubbling.html">Examples of Using the Bubbling Technique: Simple Actions</a></h3>
	<p>Benefits from the bubbling up technique: Untied your XHTML code from the javascript listeners, no more addListener in your code. Just define the class of each link, and the corresponding behavior for each linkÂ´s class.</p>

	<h3><a href="behavior-actionprompt-anchor-button.html">How to define a global behavior using the Bubbling Technique: Global Behaviors</a></h3>
	<p>In this example you will see how to define a global behavior called "actionGlobalBahavior", and every link or button in this page that have a className equal to "actionGlobalBahavior" will fire this behavior, even when the element is created form JavaScript or by another component in the page, even before or after the definition of the global behavior.</p>
	<h3><a href="bubbling.html">Global Behaviors Definition: See this advanced example to learn more about the global behaviors</a> (<span class="style1">NEW</span>)</h3>
	<p>In this example you  will see a full explanation, step by step, of the possibilities of this  technique, including dynamic behaviors (behaviors can be activated onDemand). </p>
	<h3><a href="behavior-shortcuts-anchor-button.html">How to define keyboard shortcuts using the Bubbling Technique: Behaviors' shortcuts</a> (<span class="style1">NEW</span>)</h3>
	<p>In this example you will see how to define keyboard shortcuts that will fire a certain behaviors.</p>

	<h3><a href="behavior-dynamic-focus-bubbling.html">Bubbling Technique: actionSetFocus</a></h3>
	<p>Define links to set the focus in each field in a form.</p>
	<h3><a href="repainting-resize-scroll.html">How to deal with floating elements: Repainting the viewport</a> (<span class="style1">NEW</span>)</h3>
	<p>In this example you will see how to use the bubbling core to repaint certain elements when something change in the viewport using the &quot;repaint&quot; behaviors layer. The  bubbling CORE will define a set of listeners to monitoring the browser  (font size, scrolling, browser resize, etc), creating   pipes to take certain actions.</p>
	<h3><a target="blank" href="topnavwithshotcuts.html">Defining keyboard shorcuts for YUI Menus</a><a href="repainting-resize-scroll.html"></a> (<span class="style1">NEW</span>)</h3>
	<p><span class="description">In this example you will see how to add keyboard shortcuts for menu items and submenus in a YUI Menu bar.</span></p>
  <h2>Other Examples</h2>
  <h3><a href="../dispatcher/framework/index.php">Processing all the clicks on the page</a> </h3>
    <p>Now you will see how  to use a global behavior to create a dynamic navigable website (the links in  the left menu load the corresponding content in the central area of the page  using the YUI Connection Manager). All the clicks are wrapped by the global behavior,  and certain actions are used, depending of the target for each event.</p>

  <h3><a href="../tooltips/tooltips-for-many-elements.html">Rollover and Rollout behaviors layers</a> </h3>
    <p>The  previous  examples, were related with the navigation behaviors (click), now we can see  how to use the mouseover/mouseout events to fire certain behaviors, getting as  a result a nice dynamic &quot;tooltips&quot;, even to dynamic elements created  on the fly.</p>
